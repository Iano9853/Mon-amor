  <h2>Digital Love Letter</h2>
  <p>Dear Ashley,</p>
  <p>Happy Valentine's Day

My love

You're the best thing ever happened in my life. Thank you for appearing in my life and making it so beautiful just by being in it. I really feel a strong connection everytime I see you as if that I am being drawn by you in a way that I've never ever experienced before. Thank you for making me experience a lot of things in a very short time. <br><br>Thank you for being my biggest supporter and loving me even with my flaws. I really appreciate you more than I can show. I really hope you know how much you mean to me. You're such a wonderful person with a pure soul. Let's not give up on each other and celebrate every Valentine's Day together. 

    <br>
    <br>
I am so lucky having you as the love of my life. You came into my life and made me a better person. Even when I get mad at you, I want you to know that I love you and I will never like to lose you. <br><br>When I wake up in the morning, the thought of you makes me feel strong, when I am going to bed in the night, you are the reason for my peaceful sleep.

You are among the greatest gift that God gave to me and that is why I always thank him everyday for bringing you across my way. I don't know how my life would have been if you weren't mine.
